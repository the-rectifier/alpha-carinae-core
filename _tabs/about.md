# Whoami

Hello everyone, my name is Odysseus, an Electrical and Computer Engineer from [TU Crete](https://www.tuc.gr/). My nickname/hacker monicker is Canopus. Designated `α Carinae`, is the brightest star in the constellation of [Carina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carina_(constellation)) and the 2nd brightest star of the Night Sky. Stemming the ancient Greek name Κάνωβος (Kanôbos), the Pilot of Menelaus' ship during the Trojan War. Much like the legend, this blog serves as a home (and a guide) to all things CTFs, Forensics, Research, personal Projects and my many peculiarities.
